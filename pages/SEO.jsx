        <em>
          <strong>Search Engine Optimization </strong>
        </em>
        refers to the way websites operate in a manner that can be read and
        displayed easily by search engines. The higher the optimization score,
        the more likely it is that search engines will present your site above
        others in a given search criterion. This is important as many people
        often search for their sites in engines such as Google instead of typing
        an entire url into the address bar, especially on mobile. Because of
        this, it is imperative that sites maintain peak optimization through
        appealing to the bots that are responsible for crawling the internet to
        give us information.
