        The easy part is defining countless metadata for bots to parse;
        ironically, other bots can do that work. The best way to make the most
        of your site is by maximizing user engagement. Reach accessibility quota
        to give every user the opportunity to have the best experience. Ensure
        mobile reliability for site access on phones and tablets. Create
        eye-grabbing content that is sure to garner interest upon initial
        glance. Every form of best practice coupled with enough influence to
        drive growth will make certain a well optimized site can reach the top
        of its SEO ranking.
